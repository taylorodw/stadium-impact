# About Data, Maps, and Charts
This project uses data obtained from the US Census Bureau. I used Kyle Walkerâ€™s library [Tidycensus](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/) for R to access data directly from the census. Then, I passed the data into Python, where I used [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/about.html) to filter, explore, and process it. All of the scripts I wrote to collect, wrangle, and visualize data for this project are available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/taylorodw/stadium-impact-analysis).

Once data wrangling was (mostly) complete, I used a library called [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/ ) to create maps and charts. Bokeh has tight integration with Pandas, and comes with built-in features for interactivity. This was a great help in two ways. Firstly, I could quickly make simple plots for my own use in exploring and understanding the data. Secondly, it allowed me to make more refined and interactive plots for presentation here.

This website was created using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The source code is available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/taylorodw/stadium-impact ) as well.
